# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Table Name Mismatch** ‚úÖ
   - **Problem**: Code was trying to insert into `tetraccess` table

   - **Fix**: Updated all references in `lib/supabase.ts` to use `MU_data`

### 2. **Enhanced Error Logging** ‚úÖ
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the authentication flow
   - Better error messages to identify issues quickly
   - Detailed database error reporting

### 3. **Database Connection Verified** ‚úÖ
   - Created test script that confirmed database connection works
   - Verified insert, update, and delete operations work correctly
   - Confirmed Service Role Key has proper permissions

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/supabase.ts`**
   - Changed table name from `tetraccess` to `MU_data`
   - Added warning if Service Role Key is missing
   - Enhanced error logging with detailed error information

2. **`app/api/auth/callback/google/route.ts`**
   - Added comprehensive logging at each step
   - Better error handling and reporting
   - More descriptive error messages

3. **Created `supabase-setup-mu-data.sql`**
   - Setup script specifically for the `MU_data` table
   - Includes proper triggers and indexes

4. **Created `scripts/test-mu-data-connection.js`**
   - Diagnostic script to test database connectivity
   - Verifies insert, update, and delete operations

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C) and restart
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Authentication Flow
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Complete Google OAuth flow
4. Check the browser console and terminal for detailed logs

### Step 3: Verify Data in Supabase
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Table Editor ‚Üí `MU_data`
3. You should see your user record with email, access_token, and refresh_token

## Expected Logs in Terminal

When authentication succeeds, you should see:
```
üîê OAuth callback received
üìã Callback parameters: { hasCode: true, hasError: false, baseUrl: '...' }
‚úÖ Authorization code received
‚úÖ Successfully obtained OAuth tokens
‚úÖ Successfully fetched user info for: your@email.com
üíæ Attempting to save credentials for: your@email.com
‚úÖ Successfully saved credentials
‚úÖ Successfully saved credentials to Supabase for: your@email.com
```

If there's an error, you'll see detailed error messages pointing to the exact issue.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Table does not exist"
- Run the SQL setup script `supabase-setup-mu-data.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### Error: "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is not set"
- Make sure your `.env.local` has the correct `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Restart the development server after updating environment variables

### Error: "401 Authentication failed"
- This was likely the table name mismatch issue
- The fix should resolve this
- Check terminal logs for specific error details

## Next Steps

1. Restart your development server
2. Try signing up again
3. Check the terminal for detailed logs
4. If issues persist, the logs will now provide specific error details

## Environment Variables Check

Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xthxutsliqptoodkzrcp.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
